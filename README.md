DATASET  USED

KAGGLE:

•	Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.
  Kaggles allows users to find and publish data sets,explore and build models in a web based data science environment,work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

•	This datasets contains 1,309 rows and 12 columns.

•	The dataset is divided into two parts for training and testing. 
  The training dataset (train.csv) contains 891 rows and the testing dataset (test.csv) contains 418 rows.

•	This dataset was created to predict the survival on the Titanic and answers the questions such as “ what sort of people would have survived the disaster?”.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

With this dataset, we have explored the data and compared prediction models to find out more about how likely were people to survive on the titanic using the passenger data.To yield better survival results, we will be going through several steps such as data pre-processing, feature selection, model selection, etc. to make prediction and measure its performance.
